  # Waste Classifier System Using Machine Learning and Computer Vision with Android App
A small scale representation of automating the waste segregation process by using Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Android 




## 1. Camera Detects an Object
<img src = "images/show.png" width = "70%">

<br>

## 2. Object is Classified as Organic or Recyclable Waste
<img src = "images/predict.png" width = "70%">

<br>

## 3. Instantly Updates on App through Database
<kbd><img src = "images/ss1.png" height = 70%></kbd>  
<br>
<img src = "images/ss2.png" height = 70%>

## In a real waste plant setting, a mechanism to segregate the waste based on the prediction of the model can be implemented.
